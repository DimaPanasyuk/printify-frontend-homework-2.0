## High level overview structure of the app

- Home page has a search component
- Blueprint page has some details about the blueprint

## Mockups for inspiration
<small>These are only for a high level overview of the expected structure. Business logic is priority.</small>

#### Blueprint grid

## Requirements
1. Request are done using Printify mock API below
2. Clicking a blueprint should open the blueprint page
3. A blueprint page has details about the blueprint. (_In this case the API for 1 blueprint always returns the same blueprint i.e. the blueprint page will always have the same blueprint data_)
4. Blueprints grid can be filtered with a search input
5. No search result shows an empty search result message
